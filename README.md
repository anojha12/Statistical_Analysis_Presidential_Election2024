# Unveiling Voter Trends: Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling for the 2024 US Election

## Overview
The landscape of American politics has undergone significant transformations in recent years, driven by increased complexity and rapidly changing demographic patterns. This project explores the key factors that influenced the outcomes of the 2020 and 2024 U.S. presidential elections, with a particular focus on demographic, political, and social trends that shaped voter preferences.
The study highlights the Republican Party's victory in 2024, analyzing the underlying forces behind this result, especially in the context of the contentious 2020 election. By incorporating data exploration and machine learning techniques, this project provides a comprehensive understanding of the evolving political landscape in the United States.

## Features
### 1. **Data Exploration**
- **Data Sources**:
  - Election results at the state level (2020 and 2024).
  - U.S. Census data for demographic insights (gender, race, and socio-economic factors).
- **Techniques**:
  - Data cleaning and manipulation using Python libraries such as `Pandas` and `NumPy`.
  - Univariate and multivariate analyses to identify key patterns and relationships in the data.

### 2. **Data Visualization**
- Visualizations are used to:
  - Highlight voting trends across different regions.
  - Illustrate the impact of demographic factors on voter behavior.

### 3. **Predictive Modeling**
- Machine learning algorithms applied include:
  - **Linear Regression**: To identify linear relationships between demographic factors and voting patterns.
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression**: For localized predictions based on similar states.
  - **Random Forest Regression**: To capture non-linear relationships and interactions between variables.
- Focus on swing states to understand how specific demographic trends influence election outcomes.
